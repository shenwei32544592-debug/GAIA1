# GAIA — Video PPT Script
**Simple English | For Video / Pitch Deck**

**Purpose**: Consolidated script and content source for GAIA video or PPT. Use each section as slide or scene.

---

## Slide 1 — Title

**GAIA**  
Global Art & Identity Alliance

The ideal order for artists — achievable.

---

## Slide 2 — What Does the Alliance Want to Do?

Build **the ideal order for artists**:

- **Creative sovereignty respected**
- **Attribution preserved** — source cannot be erased
- **Revenue flows back to creators** — 65% to artists
- **Peer consensus decides disputes** — no single authority

Implementation path: protocol freeze → physical artifacts → external validation → platform launch → multi-node expansion.

---

## Slide 3 — Why Does the Alliance Exist?

Current systems fail artists:

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| **Attribution lost** | Creators disappear from history and revenue while their work is copied and commercialized |
| **Justice controlled by power** | Who counts as "original" is decided by platforms, lawyers, capital — not peers |
| **Dignity reduced to data** | Art becomes files and pixels, little real-world presence |

No global protocol today protects creator sovereignty, immutably records attribution, routes revenue to sources, and uses peer consensus for disputes.

**GAIA exists to establish that protocol.**  
A civilization-level set of rules, not a single company or platform.

---

## Slide 4 — Five-Step Path

| Step | Phase | What Happens |
|------|-------|--------------|
| ① | Protocol freeze | Rules fixed, printed, not arbitrarily changed |
| ② | Physical occurrence | Real artifacts made, signed, sealed |
| ③ | External confirmation | At least one external party signs, joins, endorses |
| ④ | Platform live | Orders accepted, money received, splits executed |
| ⑤ | Multi-node expansion | More artists, more clients; system self-sustaining |

Each step is verifiable and auditable. No layer skipping.

---

## Slide 5 — Timeline (Condensed)

| Phase | Time | Key Deliverables |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **A — Protocol** | Day 1–15 | Core docs frozen; paper agreements; minimal site |
| **B — Physical** | Day 16–45 | 001 brass pen; sealed FCR; timestamped record |
| **C — External** | Day 46–90 | Forum live; first FCR grant; founding success vote |
| **D — Platform** | Post-founding | MVP; allocation engine; first cross-border payment |
| **E — Scaling** | Month 12+ | FCR cash flow; Batch 1+ repays Batch 0; institutions run |

---

## Slide 6 — Hard Prerequisites for Real-World Achievement

To achieve this goal in the real world, three hard conditions are required:

1. **Legal** — Agreements frozen, enforceable, compliant  
2. **IT** — Platform, allocation engine, traceability in place  
3. **Writing** — Rules and protocols documented, transparent, persistent  

---

## Slide 7 — Why This Is Achievable

**The hardest preconditions are already in place.**

- **Legal ✓** — Charter and Carrier Protocol can be frozen; legal core is signable  
- **IT ✓** — Architecture, allocation engine, traceability designed and in place  
- **Writing ✓** — Rules and archives documented; printable, citeable  

This is not wishful thinking.  
**It is achievable.**

---

## Slide 8 — Closing

**GAIA** — the ideal order for artists.

Creative sovereignty. Attribution preserved. Revenue to source. Consensus over power.

Hard prerequisites met.  
Not empty hope.  
Achievable.
