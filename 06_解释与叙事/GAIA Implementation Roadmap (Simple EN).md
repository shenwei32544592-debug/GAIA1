**Purpose**: External-facing roadmap for partners, artists, and stakeholders.

## North Star

Build **the ideal order for artists**:
- Creative sovereignty respected
- Attribution preserved
- Revenue flows back to creators
- Peer consensus decides disputes

## Five-Step Path

| Step | Phase | What Happens | Deliverable |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| ① | **Protocol freeze** | Rules fixed, printed, not arbitrarily changed | Paper agreements; canonical docs |
| ② | **Physical occurrence** | Real artifacts made, signed, sealed | 001 brass pen, sealed FCR |
| ③ | **External confirmation** | At least one external party signs, joins, endorses | First Founding Contributor |
| ④ | **Platform live** | Orders accepted, money received, splits executed | MVP; first cross-border payment |
| ⑤ | **Multi-node expansion** | More artists, more clients; system self-sustaining | Organic growth |

Each step is verifiable and auditable. No layer skipping.

## Timeline (Phase A–E)

### Phase A — Protocol Freeze (Day 1–15)
- Day 1–5: Freeze core docs (Carrier Protocol, FCR, CTO consensus, allocation logic)
- Day 6–10: Number docs; PDF + print
- Day 11–15: Minimal static site / roadmap page

### Phase B — Physical Occurrence (Day 16–45)
- Day 16–25: 001 physical kit (brass pen, paper, seal, archive box)
- Day 26–35: Zero moment — sign FCR with 001 pen; seal and number
- Day 36–45: Minimal video/photo record (timestamped)

### Phase C — External Confirmation (Day 46–90)
- Day 46–60: Forum live; first private invite sent
- Day 61–75: First external signee → first FCR grant
- Day 76–90: Founding success vote; FCR window closes or extends

### Phase D — Platform Live (Post-founding)
- Sprint 1: User system, artist system, template system, orders
- Sprint 2: Payment, allocation engine
- Launch: First 10 Founding Artists; first cross-border payment

### Phase E — Revenue & Scaling
- Month 12: Founding contributors verified; FCR cash flow; Batch 1+ repays Batch 0
- Month 18: Domain councils, stewards in place; allocation engine runs continuously
- Ongoing: Physical artifacts repeatable; institutions run without manual override

## Critical Path (Standard)

```
T0 → Phase A (Protocol) → Phase B (Physical) → Phase C (External) → Founding Success → Phase D (Platform) → Phase E (Revenue)
```

**Alternate path (small-step)**: Combine A+B, accept first order with manual ledger → ramp →self-sustaining threshold → founding vote → Phase E.

## Key Anchors

| Anchor | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **T0 / Day 0** | Founding start; participants, weights, threshold written |
| **Day 90** | Reference end of FCR window; founding success vote may be called |
| **Founding success** | Vote passed → FCR window closes; Batch 0 locked; Batch 1+ begins |
| **Platform live** | Can accept orders, receive payment, execute splits |
