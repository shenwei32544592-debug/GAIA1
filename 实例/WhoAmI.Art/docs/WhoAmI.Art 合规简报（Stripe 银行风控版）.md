## First Dollar Validation

**Document Type:** Compliance & Risk Overview  
**Audience:** Payment Processor / Bank Risk Officer / Compliance Team  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** 2025-02-12

## 1. What WhoAmI.Art Is (Plain English)

WhoAmI.Art is **not** a marketplace for goods, and **not** a speculative platform.

It is a digital identity licensing and fulfillment coordination system, where:

- Customers pay for **licensed creative services** and authorized outputs
- Artists retain original authorship and grant limited, revocable licenses
- The platform facilitates order routing, escrow, settlement, and audit

**No funds are distributed unless a real customer order exists.**  
There is no token, no pre-minted credit, no virtual balance trading.

---

## 2. Nature of the Transaction (Critical for Risk Classification)

Each transaction is classified as: **Creative Service Fee / Digital License Fee**

| 属性 | 说明 |
|------|------|
| Payment initiator | End customer |
| License scope | Clearly defined (personal / commercial / one-time) |
| Delivery | Digital or digitally-authorized |
| Refund & dispute | Explicit terms |
| **No** | Pooling of customer funds for investment |
| **No** | Promise of profit to customers |

## 3. Fund Flow (Simplified & Auditable)

```
Customer Payment
      ↓
Payment Processor (Stripe / Bank)
      ↓
Escrow Period (14 days)
      ↓
Automated Distribution Engine
      ↓
Artist Payout (Primary Recipient)
      ↓
Platform / Reserve Allocation (Pre-defined %)
```

**Key Controls:**
- 14-day escrow before artist payout
- Append-only ledger for every distribution event
- No manual override of payout ratios
- No advance payouts

---

## 4. Why This Is Low Risk (Compliance Perspective)

### 4.1 No Financial Engineering
- No interest, no yield, no secondary market, no customer speculation
- Revenue sharing from real services, not financial products

### 4.2 Artist Autonomy & Kill Switch
- Artists can revoke authorization (Kill Switch)
- Revocation immediately blocks new orders
- Protects against copyright or misrepresentation risk

### 4.3 Refund & Dispute Coverage
- 10% Risk & Compliance Reserve (FCR)
- Refunds and disputes resolved before artist payout
- Platform absorbs operational risk first

---

## 5. Cross-Border Compliance Logic (China-Facing Artists)

- Artists are independent service providers
- They choose their own compliant receiving accounts
- They are responsible for local tax and reporting
- Platform issues transaction records / invoices when required
- **The platform does not intermediate tax obligations**

---

## 6. Why the "First Dollar" Matters

We intentionally validate the system with real money first, before scale.

If the first dollar cannot pass compliance, the system halts.

This approach prioritizes: Payment safety, Regulatory clarity, Long-term processor trust.

## 7. What We Are Asking

- Review WhoAmI.Art as a licensed creative service facilitator
- Allow small-volume pilot transactions
- Validate escrow → payout → audit loop

**We are not requesting exemptions, only a clear classification and clean path.**

---

## 8. Contact & Next Steps

We are happy to provide:
- Sample contracts
- Sample artist authorization terms
- Live transaction walkthrough
- Audit log screenshots

**Goal: One clean transaction. Everything else follows.**
